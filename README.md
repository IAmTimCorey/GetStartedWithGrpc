# How To Get Started with gRPC in C#
Here are some good starter projects to help you get started with gRPC in C#. These are part of a conference talk on gRPC. You can also get more information on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/IAmTimCorey).

## Getting Started
There are three demo projects to check out. Start with the SimpleDemo. From there, you can check out the StreamingDemo to learn more about streaming from the client to the server or the JsonDemo to learn how in .NET 7 you can turn a gRPC service into an API as well. All of these projects rely on .NET 7.

## Tips
* Make sure the proto file has its build action set to be `Protobuf compiler`.
* Mark the proto file as either client or server unless the project needs both.
* Build the project before trying to use the C# classes generated by the proto file.
* Ensure the proto files on the client and server are in sync.
